"I want to write documents that have some variable parts."
and
"I do not want to have lots of strings in my code."

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
Large blocks of text with some calculation or lookup inserted.
Filling in boiler plate without having to keep boilerplate tied to code.
When simple string iterpolation isn't cutting it.
